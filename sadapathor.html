        Companiganj Upazila of Sylhet. Kompaniganj is a border Upazila located
        at a distance of 35 km from Sylhet city. And there is the kingdom of
        white stone (Sada Pathor). The place called 'Sada Pathar' has gained a
        reputation as a new tourist spot adjacent to Zero Point of Bholaganj
        Stone Quarry. There are white stones scattered around. It seems that
        nature has spread a white bed. Clear blue water in the middle.
        Surrounded by a few hills, large and small. Clouds seemed to fall on
        him. In addition, there is green nature all around. All in all, nature
        is like a wonderful paradise. Tourists from far and wide flock to enjoy
        this wonderful place in the land of white rocks.
