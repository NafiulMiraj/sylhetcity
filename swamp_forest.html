        Ratargul is Bangladesh's only Swamp Forest. It is located about 26km
        outside of Sylhet district city. The Ratargul forest is spread over an
        area of approximately 30,325 acres. The 504-acre site is full of
        forests, and the rest of the area is complete with small and big water
        bodies. Ratargul is known as a “Sundarbans of Sylhet”. For four to five
        months out of the year, water completely covers the ground.
